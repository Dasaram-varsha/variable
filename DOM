DOM (Document Object Model) 
It is used in web development used to interact and manipulate the html documents.
When the webpage loaded, the browser creates DOM of the webpage.
When the html file is loaded into the browser, the java script cannot understand the html document directly.
DOM: it is basically the presentation of the same html document but in a tree-like structure composed of object.
Key points:
1.	Structure: the DOM represents the structure of the html document as a tree. Each node in the tree represents the elements, an attribute or text.
2.	Manipulation: using java script, you can interact with elements (buttons, paragraphs) on the web page, changing the content, styles, can add or remove elements.
3.	Event Handling: you can handle the interactions like click or pressing a button.
4.	W3C: World wide web consortium
