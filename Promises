Promise: 
It is a special java script object used to check whether event is completed or not of an asynchronous operation.
It allows to handle asynchronous tasks more efficiently than callbacks.
Three states:
1.	Pending: initial state, the promise is still waiting for the operation to finish or still not completed(continuing)
2.	Fulfilled: the operation completed successfully
3.	Rejected: the operation failed
Explanation:
1.	To create a promise: new promise()
Constructor takes two parameters
Resolve-mark the promise as successful
Reject-mark it as failed
2.	Handling the result:
.then()-method is called when promise is fulfilled, it will receive result from resolve()
.catch()-method is called if the promise is rejected it receives the error message from reject()
